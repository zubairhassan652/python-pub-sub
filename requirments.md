Objective:

Develop a real-time, event-driven system using Redis as a message broker. The system should facilitate asynchronous communication between components via Redis Pub/Sub.

Requirements:

1.	Use Redis for Messaging:

•	Leverage Redis Pub/Sub for event-driven communication.
•	Ensure real-time message publishing and subscribing.

2.	Python Implementation:

•	Use redis-py (pip install redis) to interact with Redis.
•	Develop separate publisher and subscriber scripts.

3.	Event Flow:

•	The publisher should send an event to a Redis channel.
•	The subscriber(s) should listen to the channel and process events in real time.

4.	Concurrency Handling:
•	Implement multiple subscribers efficiently using threading/multiprocessing.


Implementation Steps:
1.	Set up Redis locally or use a cloud Redis instance.

2.	Develop the Publisher Script:
•	Connect to Redis.
•	Publish messages to a designated Redis channel.

3.	Develop the Subscriber Script:
•	Subscribe to the Redis channel.
•	Process incoming messages and log the output.

4.	Test the System:
•	Run multiple subscribers.
•	Publish events and verify that they are properly received.

Bonus Features (Optional):
•	Implement event filtering based on message type.
•	Use Redis Streams for event queuing.
•	Integrate a web interface (Flask/FastAPI) to trigger events.

Expected Deliverables:
•	Source code for Publisher and Subscriber.
•	Step-by-step guide for running the system.
•	Demonstration of real-time event communication.
